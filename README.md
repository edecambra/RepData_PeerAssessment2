Human and Economic Costs of Weather Events: A United States View
========================================================
Here NOAA data on historical weather events is remotely downloaded into R, and combined with R markdown formats to produce this report.  R markdown integrates human readable output with R scripts used to generate the analysis.  The code uses extensive general expression coding to help format the relatively messy text data prior to analyses.

The Final report is hosted on R studio's Rpubs site https://rpubs.com/edecambra/PeerAssessment2, and can be reproduced with the included r code on any machine with R installed.
